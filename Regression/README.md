# Regression

Inside this folder one can find the different scripts used to generate the results shown in the Table 2 of the article. However, the dataset used is not publicly available so the experiments can't be reproduced.
The experiments can be executed launching the bash scripts in the same way they are launched for the classification experiments. This is explained in the README.md of the other folder in this GitHub repository, in the section: **Training_Losses**
